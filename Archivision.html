                        Archivision is a digital platform designed to streamline the management and presentation of architectural portfolios. The project aimed to create a user-friendly interface for architects and designers to showcase their work, organize project assets, and collaborate with clients or teams efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The primary challenge was to balance a visually compelling design with robust functionality, ensuring that users could easily upload, categorize, and share high-resolution images, drawings, and project documentation.
